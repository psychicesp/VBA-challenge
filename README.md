# VBA-challenge
Second homework assignment

The module in this folder will loop through the sheets of "Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx"

It will create the table headings of the two requested tables on each sheet, populate it with the collected and calculated data.

It will automatically create the headings of the output tables and automatically switch between sheets.  It does not, however, automatically add any formatting, conditional or otherwise.

For this module to run on similar workbooks with a different number of sheets or whose sheets have different names the code would need to be manually updated in the "For j..." loop to add the new sheet names and the appropriate number of loops.

Other than that it works great!
